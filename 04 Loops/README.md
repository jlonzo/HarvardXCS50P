# Unit 4: Loops

## Problem Set

1. Deep Thought  
	In `deep.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting `Yes` if the user inputs `42` or (case-insensitively) `forty-two` or `forty two`. Otherwise output `No`.

2. Home Federal Savings Bank  
	In a file called `bank.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output `$0`. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output `$20`. Otherwise, output `$100`. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.

3. File Extensions  
	In a file called `extensions.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs that file’s media type if the file’s name ends, case-insensitively, in any of these suffixes:  
	* `.gif`
	* `.jpg`
	* `.jpeg`
	* `.png`
	* `.pdf`
	* `.txt`
	* `.zip`

If the file’s name ends with some other suffix or has no suffix at all, output `application/octet-stream` instead, which is a common default.

4. Math Interpreter
In a file called `interpreter.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted as `x y z`, with one space between `x` and `y` and one space between `y` and `z`, wherein:  
	* `x` is an integer
	* `y` is `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`
    * `z` is an integer

For instance, if the user inputs `1 + 1`, your program should output `2.0`. Assume that, if `y` is `/`, then `z` will not be `0`.

Note that, just as `python` itself is an interpreter for Python, so will your `interpreter.py` be an interpreter for math!

5. Meal Time  
	In `meal.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it’s `breakfast time`, `lunch time`, or `dinner time`. If it’s not time for a meal, don’t output anything at all. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted in 24-hour time as `#:##` or `##:##`. And assume that each meal’s time range is inclusive. For instance, whether it’s 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, or anytime in between, it’s time for breakfast.

	Structure your program per the below, wherein `convert` is a function (that can be called by `main`) that converts `time`, a `str` in 24-hour format, to the corresponding number of hours as a `float`. For instance, given a `time` like `"7:30"` (i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes), `convert` should return `7.5` (i.e., 7.5 hours).

### Unit 4: Loops

1. camelCase  
	In a file called `camel.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. Assume that the user’s input will indeed be in camel case.

2. Coke Machine  
	In a file called `coke.py`, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isn’t an accepted denomination.

3. Just setting up my twittr  
	 In a file called `twttr.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a `str` of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

4. Vanity Plates  
	In `plates.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a vanity plate and then output `Valid` if meets all of the requirements or `Invalid` if it does not. Assume that any letters in the user’s input will be uppercase. Structure your program per the below, wherein `is_valid` returns `True` if `s` meets all requirements and `False` if it does not. Assume that `s` will be a `str`. You’re welcome to implement additional functions for `is_valid` to call (e.g., one function per requirement).

	<pre>
	def main():
    plate = input("Plate: ")
    if is_valid(plate):
        print("Valid")
    else:
        print("Invalid")

	def is_valid(s):
    ...


	main()
	</pre>

5. Nutrition Facts  
	In a file called `nutrition.py`, implement a program that prompts consumers users to input a fruit (case-insensitively) and then outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, per the [FDA’s poster for fruits](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/2/nutrition/Nutrition-Information-for-Raw-Fruits---small-PDF-Poster.pdf), which is also [available as text](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/raw-fruits-poster-text-version-accessible-version). Capitalization aside, assume that users will input fruits exactly as written in the poster (e.g., `strawberries`, not `strawberry`). Ignore any input that isn’t a fruit.
